# Build instructions:
Utilizing the `main.py` and `responses.py` files, create the `.env` file after getting it from my bot testing server (github wont let me add it in the repo)
Download the csv dataset in the `/data` directory and include it in the project directory
Run and access it

-Other way, please contact me and we can set up a time where I can run it and you can use some of the functionality
-I've also invoked a few sample commands in the chat history. Which will be recorded into a seperate document explaining the code.
